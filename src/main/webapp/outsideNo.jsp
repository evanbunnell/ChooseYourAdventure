<body>
	<p>You take a seat by the cottage.  You're not any less wet, but at least you're sitting down.  The rain doesn't hit you as hard near 
	the cottage.<br/>
	<br/>
	You wait what feels like an hour.  You begin to hear a growling noise.  Then another.  Then a cacophony of growls surround you.  
	Pairs of yellow, beaded eyes start to appear in front of you.  You begin to stand up quickly.<br/>
	<br/>
	You're too slow.  The wolves pounce on you and begin attacking you.  You are helpless.  You die.</p>
