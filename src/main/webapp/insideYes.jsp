<body>
	<p>You begin to eat the food.  The bread is stale and hard to chew.  The apple is mealy, but not rotten.<br/>
	<br/>
	As you set the core of the apple down on the table, you feel a stinging pain against your neck.  
	You look down to see blood beginning to soak your already soiled shirt.  You hear a man muttering behind you.<br/>
	<br/>
	"You shouldn't eat another man's food without askin' 'im first," he growls.  "You won't be doin' that again."<br/>
	<br/>
	You are unable to breathe.  As you gasp for air, you turn to see the man, but he's hidden in shadows.  
	You fall to the floor as you see the glint of his dagger hit the floor next to you.
	The see the shadow of a man leave the cottage.  It is the last thing you see before you die.</p>
