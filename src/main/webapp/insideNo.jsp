<body>
	<p>You take a seat by the window.  Every few minutes you turn back to the table to see the food still sitting there, begging to be eaten.  
	But it is not your food.<br/>
	<br/>
	A few moments pass as you wait.  You see a man approaching the cottage.  The man does not look nice.  
	You move slowly towards the corner of the cottage where the light does not reach.<br/>
	<br/>
	The man enters and absentmindedly moves to sit at the table.  He sits, lets out a large sigh, and begins eating the food.  
	You bolt for the door, slamming it behind you.<br/>
	<br/>
	"Who's there?!" the man shouts.  You keep running.<br/>
	<br/>
	You run for as long as your legs will carry you.  You look back to see if anyone is following you.  Nobody.  
	You start making your way out of the woods, towards your house.  It's been a long day and you feel lucky to be alive.</p>
